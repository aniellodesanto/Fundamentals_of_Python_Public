<h1 id="catalog-description">Catalog description</h1>
<p>This course is an introduction to programming principles using Python. Students will acquire basic programming skills, knowledge of fundamental coding concepts, and the ability to write scripts for simple language-oriented tasks. Linguistic examples will be used to motivate the introduction of new coding concepts. We will discuss the language technologies of our daily life - spam filtering, machine translation, and more - and how they work under the hood.</p>
<p>No previous training in mathematics, linguistics, or computer science required.</p>
<h1 id="goals-and-objectives">Goals and Objectives</h1>
<ul>
<li>acquire core programming skills generalizable to any programming language</li>
<li>master essential concepts and techniques in Python programming</li>
<li>conceptualize linguistics problems in computational terms</li>
<li>translate abstract computational models into fully functional source code</li>
<li>develop learning autonomy and the ability to deepen your programming knowledge through self-study</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>
<p>Officially: LING 1069 OR LING 1200 OR ENGL 1200. But get in touch with me if you are interested in the course and haven't fulfilled the prerequisites.</p>
<h1 id="format">Format</h1>
<p>The course is scheduled to run in a hybrid format, alternating in-person and online instruction. Students will be provided with materials (annotated notebooks + short video introductions) to study asynchronously in the first part of the week. We will then meet in person on Wednesdays. Wednesday lectures will be organized as hands-on labs, during which students will be guided through a deeper understanding of the materials studied online. Wednesday lectures will be recorded and made available on Canvas. Details about the first week of classes will follow via email.</p>
<h2 id="required-materials-and-resources">Required Materials and Resources</h2>
<p><strong>All you need for this course is a device with a recent browser</strong> (Windows, OS X, or Linux computer, Chromebook, Android tablet), and an internet connection. Ensure you have these ahead of time as they will be required to complete assignments and activities throughout the course. If you anticipate tech-related issues, please get in touch with me early in the semester.</p>
<p>We will be using <em>Jupyter Notebook</em>, an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Notebooks will contain both study materials and homework for each week. I recommend you work on your notebooks remotely via <em>CoLab</em>, an online environment that allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with no configuration required and free access to GPUs. However, executing Jupyter locally on your own machine is also possible. We will go over the details in the first week of classes.</p>
<p>All class materials will be distributed on Canvas (you can familiarize yourself with Canvas <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10701"><strong>here</strong></a>), but will also be available on the course Github page (a brief Github tutorial can be found <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/"><strong>here</strong></a>). Short videos will be distributed summarizing the content of each notebook to facilitate online study.</p>
<p>No book is required for this course, as plenty of introductory programming resources are available online for free. However, if you feel the need for a more structured reference you can check out <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/"><strong>Automate The Boring Stuff with Python</strong> (the pdf is available for free)</a>.</p>
<h2 id="slack-channel">Slack Channel</h2>
<p>To facilitate remote discussion/collaboration among peers with limited in person contact, this course has an associated Slack channel. Slack is a collaborative chatroom environment extensively used for Team synchronization in the tech industry. You can create a free account and join the course channel with this invite: <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/pythonfundamentals-hq/shared_invite/zt-g3fmvghe-YjweAQELxNlZmun7_Blhpw" class="uri">https://join.slack.com/t/pythonfundamentals-hq/shared_invite/zt-g3fmvghe-YjweAQELxNlZmun7_Blhpw</a>. <strong>Make sure to join the channel before the first week of classes.</strong></p>
<h1 id="grading">Grading</h1>
<p>Student grades are determined by the following components:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Weekly homework (70%)</strong><br />
Students have to solve weekly programming assignments in Python. One homework may take the form of
<ul>
<li>several minor practice exercises, or</li>
<li>a single, more open ended coding task (e.g. implementing a simple chatbot for English).</li>
</ul>
<p>Assignments are unlocked each Monday and, unless stated otherwise, are due the following Sunday at 11:59pm. Details on the requirements for each assignment will be shared with the students in advance. <strong>Assignments must be submitted via email.</strong> When computing the final grade, the lowest homework grade will be dropped.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Midterm (5%)</strong><br />
We will have an in-class, pen-and-paper (no computer) coding midterm, which will take the form of several self-contained coding exercises.</p></li>
<li><strong>Class participation (25%)</strong><br />
Class participation is highly encouraged and can take various forms:
<ul>
<li>asking questions in class</li>
<li>participating during in-class discussions</li>
<li>participating in office hours</li>
<li>pointing out problems with the lecture notes (e.g. typos, confusing wording, broken code)</li>
<li>frequent use of the course Slack channel (this includes both asking questions of your own and answering fellow students' questions)</li>
<li>suggesting topics for lectures</li>
<li>posting links to relevant online material (e.g. tutorials or news paper articles)</li>
<li>participating in the Linguistics Department research events (e.g. colloquia)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Extra-credits</strong></p>
<p>It is possible for you to earn TWO extra credit for this course (up to 5% of your final grade). This can be accomplished by</p>
<ul>
<li>participating in one (or more) experimental Linguistic stud(ies), <strong>and/or</strong></li>
<li>attending a Department of Linguistics colloquium talk.</li>
</ul>
<p>To sign up for a linguistic study, please visit: http://speechlab.utah.edu/participate. php.  <strong>Note that you are strongly encouraged to sign up early, rather than wait to the end of the semester to participate.</strong> If for any reason you are not comfortable participating in Linguistics studies for credit in this course, an alternative assignment will be made available. If you need accommodation of any kind, have a question about accommodation, and/or prefer to complete an alternative assignment for any reason, please create a Sona account and then email at speechacquisitionlab@gmail.com. Arrangements for alternative assignments must be made before the current semester's add/drop deadline. If no study appointments are available, check back later, as new appointments are added periodically. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the Linguistics Study Pool or the Sona sign-up system, please contact the Linguistic Study Pool coordinators at speechacquisitionlab@gmail.com.</p>
<p>If you attend a colloquium talk, to receive credit you have to write a 1 page (typed double-spaced) summary of what the talk was about, including your general opinions on the presentation. Comments do not have to pertain to the scientific content of the talk (although that is obviously welcome), but can be about presentation style/clarity/etc. This report is officially due on the last day of class, but may be turned in on Canvas as soon as it is complete. For information about the time and location of Linguistics talks by department faculty and visiting faculty from other institutions visit the Department webpage.</p></li>

<h2 id="guildelines-for-online-weeks">Guildelines for online weeks</h2>
<p>During the weeks of September 27 - October 11 and November 30 - December 3, classes will be held fully online. The current plan is to host brief synchronous online meetings via zoom, scheduled on Wednesdays during normal class time. Students will be required to come to those sessions having prepared questions to be discussed together.</p>
<h1 id="general-policies">General Policies</h1>
<h2 id="contacting-me">Contacting me</h2>
<ul>
<li>Emails should be sent to aniello.desanto@utah.edu</li>
<li>Please put LING 5981/6080 into the subject of the email, and <em>never</em> leave the subject empty!</li>
<li>Reply time &lt; 24h in simple cases, possibly more if meddling with bureaucracy is involved.</li>
<li>We will discuss the format for office hours the first day of classes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h2>
<p>Office hours will take place twice per week in a dedicated Zoom room (the link will be made available on Canvas).</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-office-hours">A Note on Office hours</h3>
<p>You might feel like you need to have a specific question (e.g., about a homework) in order to come to office hours. This is <em>not</em> true. <strong>Office hours are a space for us to discuss any issue/concern you might be having with the class, and you are always welcome regardless of whether you have a precise question or not.</strong> Thus, you also do not need an appointment to show up to office hours. However, if you anticipate a longer meeting, it might be helpful for you to email me in advance so that we can set apart enough time and avoid collisions with other students.</p>
<h2 id="laptop-policy">Laptop policy</h2>
<p>This course requires laptops use during class (if you have tech problems, please contact me in advance). I recommend that you avoid using your laptop in class for activities that are not directly related to the lecture (e.g., following a Jupyter notebook in Python sessions). However, I do not enforce restrictions on how to use laptops. Note that cognitive scientists are still debating how/whether laptop use in the classroom is related to test scores:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Raviza, S. M., Uitvlugt, M. G., &amp; Fenn, K. M. (2016). <a href="http://faculty.missouri.edu/segerti/1000/LaptopClassroomUse.pdf"><em>Logged in and zoned out: How laptop Internet use relates to classroom learning</em></a>. Psychological Science, 28(2), 171–180.</p></li>
<li><p>Urry Heather L. et al (2020). <a href="https://assert.pub/papers/vqyw6"><em>Don't Ditch the Laptop Just Yet: A Direct Replication of Mueller and Oppenheimer's (2014) Study 1 Plus Mini-Meta-Analyses Across Similar Studies</em></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since we all have different needs, these are just recommendations. You can do as you please, as long as you are not disruptive to the class.</p>
<h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
<p>Attendance is strongly encouraged but it is not required. Students may elect not to attend class in-person with no penalty and do not need to seek an official accommodationto participate online, rather than in-person. However, if you elect to follow the course purely online, I would appreciate to be informed so to keep track of every student participation modality.</p>
<h2 id="late-submissions">Late submissions</h2>
<p>Because of the highly incremental nature of the materials, I discourage late submissions. However, life can get in the way, thus I allow 2 late submissions without need for justification, as long as you warn me before the deadline. After those:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other Homework extensions must be requested <strong>before</strong> the deadline (and, within reason, are usually granted);</li>
<li>Late submissions that had not been discussed before will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="namespronouns.">Names/Pronouns.</h2>
<p>Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name as well as <em>Preferred first name</em> (if previously entered by you in the Student Profile section of your CIS account, which managed can be managed at any time). While CIS refers to this as merely a preference, I will honor you by referring to you with the name and pronoun that feels best for you in class or on assignments. Please advise me of any name or pronoun changes so I can help create a learning environment in which you, your name, and your pronoun are respected. If you need any assistance or support, please reach out to the LGBT Resource Center: <a href="https://lgbt.utah.edu/campus/faculty_resources.php" class="uri">https://lgbt.utah.edu/campus/faculty_resources.php</a></p>
<h1 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h1>

<p>It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture.</p>
<p>I also aim to maximize accessibility for all my lecture materials. However, it is probable that I miss or underestimate some issues. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated.<br />
Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In addition, if any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me know so that we can make arrangements for you.</p>
<h1 id="covid-policies">COVID Policies</h1>
<h2 id="face-coverings-requirements">Face coverings requirements</h2>
<p>Based on CDC guidelines, the University requires everyone to wear face coverings in shared public spaces on campus, including our classroom. As a reminder, when I wear a face covering, I am protecting you. When you wear a face covering, you are protecting me and all of your classmates. If you forget your face covering, I will ask you to leave class to retrieve it. If you repeatedly fail to wear a face coveringin class, I will refer you to the Dean of Students for a possible violation of the Student Code. Note that some students mayqualify for accommodations through the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). If you think you meet these criteria and desire an exception to the face covering policy,contact the Center for Disability and Access(CDA). Accommodations should be obtained prior to the first day of class so that I am notified by CDA of any students who are not required to wear a face covering.</p>
